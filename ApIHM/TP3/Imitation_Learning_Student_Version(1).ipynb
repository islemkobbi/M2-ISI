        "Imitation Learning (IL) is a set of techniques aimed at training a model to directly mimic an expert's actions from a collection of demonstrations. In this practical, we focus on **offline imitation learning**, meaning we assume there exists a dataset consisting of demonstration data in which each sample correspond to a state-action pair collected from the expert. In practice, this might mean collecting keystrokes of a human player on an Atari game, controls of a human-driven car, or medical decisions of a doctor along a course of treatment. In this case, the goal of an IL algorithm is to learn a policy (i.e., a full mapping from states to actions) that mimics the expert policy (for which you only have a set of observations)."
