    "\n",
    "[DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)](https://github.com/deap) is a library for implementing and experimenting with evolutionary algorithms in Python. It provides a wide range of tools and operators to facilitate the design and optimization of genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and other evolutionary algorithms. In this tutorial, we will cover the basic concepts and features of DEAP, along with a practical example of solving a simple optimization problem using genetic algorithms."

    "* base: The base module in DEAP provides the fundamental base classes and structures that are essential for implementing evolutionary algorithms. It includes classes like Fitness, Individual, and Toolbox that are used to define the fitness evaluation, individual representation, and the toolbox containing the operators and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* creator: The creator module in DEAP is used to create new classes for the fitness and individual. It provides a convenient way to define the attributes and behaviors of these classes. In the tutorial, we use the creator module to create the FitnessMin class (to represent a minimization fitness) and the Individual class (to represent an individual in the population).\n",

    "* tools: The tools module in DEAP provides a set of utility functions and operators commonly used in evolutionary algorithms. It includes functions for initializing populations, selecting individuals, applying genetic operators like crossover and mutation, and more. In the tutorial, we register functions like initRepeat, selTournament, cxTwoPoint, and mutGaussian from the tools module to define the initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation operations."
